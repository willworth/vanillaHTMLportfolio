npm sass script uses -w flag which is for watch -o which is output

"hello": "echo \"hello from scripts\"",


for some reason node sass isn't working so using:

sass --watch main.scss ../dist/main.css


background: lighten($primColor, 2);


but for the transparency

background: rgba(lighten($primColor, 2), 0.5);

the rgba allows you to also have an opacity... great for seethrough imgs...
